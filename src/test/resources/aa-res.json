At the doses of 900 or 1342 mg/kg, signs of lethargy, decreased motor activity, ataxia, and prone posture were observed (IUCLID (2000)). Based on these observations, the substance was classified into Category 2 (nervous system). In dermal administration tests using rabbits, no abnormalities were detected in 8 of the 10 animals treated with 2000 mg/kg based on visual inspection; one of the two remaining animals (it is noted that this animal got cut around the neck and in the mouth during the experiment) showed red staining on the skin around the mouth, and clear discharge on fur around the nares, distended abdomen, as well as distended small intestines, cecum and stomach with abnormal contents and vascularized stomach and cecum. However, it is noted that these observations are not clearly attributable to iprodione (IUCLID (2000)). Furthermore, in inhalation tests using rats, clinical signs were unspecific at the dose of 5.16 mg/L/4h and they were observed on the day of exposure and up to 2 days after the exposure; the signs observed include blepharospasm, periocular and perinasal wetness, periocular and perinasal encrustation, unkempt fur, and white powder on the fur (IUCLID (2000)).

In 99-week oral administration (mixed diet) tests using mice, the kidney with irregular cortical scarring and altered shape were observed at a higher incidence in females at 4000 ppm; in the liver, an increased incidence of enlarged eosinophilic and fat-containing hepatocytes was observed in animals of each sex at the highest dose; and centrilobular hepatocyte enlargement was observed in female rats treated with 800 ppm (conversion value: 120 mg/kg bw /day) and both sexes treated with 4000 ppm. Pigmented macrophages and centrilobular hepatocyte vacuolation were found in males at 4000 ppm; and haemosiderosis in the spleen, amyloidosis, and cortical scarring in the kidneys were reported in female mice at the highest dose (JMPR (1995). In 28-day oral administration (mixed diet) tests, exposure to 6000 ppm or higher was associated with ataxia and lethargy; livers had a stippled appearance on gross examination, and the incidence of hepatocyte vacuolation and focal eosinophilic degeneration was increased at 6000 ppm or higher. At 15000 ppm, granulomatous inflammation (possibly in response to a foreign body) was observed in the heart, liver, and kidney (JMPR (1992). In 4-week oral administration (mixed diet) using mice, depression and ataxia were observed at 6000 ppm or higher. Gross necropsy revealed white foci in the liver of mice receiving 1900 ppm (male: 366 mg/kg bw /day; female: 439 mg/kg bw /day) and higher, a stippled appearance of the liver at 6000 ppm and higher, and liver enlargement at 9500 and 15000 ppm. White foci and granulomatous inflammation were observed in numerous tissues, primarily at the high dose. One granulomatous lesion was observed in the liver at 6000 ppm and five were observed in the bladder at 9500 ppm. The presence of spindle-shaped clear spaces in tissues and foreign body type giant cells suggested a reaction to crystal formation (JMPR (1992)). In 4-week oral administration (mixed diet) tests using mice, crystalline deposits and effects on the liver were observed at 6000 ppm or higher, and granulomatous lesions surrounding crystal deposits were found frequently in the urinary bladder and occasionally in liver parenchyma, myocardium, diaphragmatic muscle, and skeletal muscle. It was speculated that the crystals contained a major metabolite of iprodione (32490 R.P.), which was identified in the liver. Liver effects included increased weight, pale and mottled appearance on gross examination, and swelling of hepatocytes to form large homogeneous areas in the centrilobular region of the liver. Histopathological changes in the testes and spleen were observed at doses levels above 6000 ppm (JMPR (1992)). In 3-month oral administration (mixed diet) tests using rats, effects on the liver, spleen and thymus were observed at high doses in small examinations carried out (JMPR (1992)); however these observations were made on animals that received doses higher than guidance values.",

Of the findings described above, the information of hyperplasia of squamous epithelial cells in forestomach at 300mg/kg and higher was not adopted for the basis for classification of specific target organ toxicity because it was caused by the irritating potency of the substance. In conclusion, it was difficult to consider the significant toxic effects based on the findings at 1000mg/kg (converted dose level as that of 90-day study: 311 mg/kg/day) with only slight clinical symptoms and changes in body weight and the organ weights. Thus, the classification corresponded to the \"Not classified\" category for oral route. However, no data were available to classify for the other routes, the classification for specific target organ toxicity (repeated exposure) was concluded as \"Classification not possible\".",

In addition, no treatment-related abnormalities were found in both sexes at necropsy performed on day 14 after dosing (\"Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals\" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (Access on Aug. 2010)).

Of the findings described above, the information of hyperplasia of squamous epithelial cells in forestomach at 300mg/kg and higher was not adopted for the basis for classification of specific target organ toxicity because it was caused by the irritating potency of the substance. In conclusion, it was difficult to consider the significant toxic effects based on the findings at 1000mg/kg (converted dose level as that of 90-day study: 311 mg/kg/day) with only slight clinical symptoms and changes in body weight and the organ weights. Thus, the classification corresponded to the \"Not classified\" category for oral route. However, no data were available to classify for the other routes, the classification for specific target organ toxicity (repeated exposure) was concluded as \"Classification not possible\".",

As clinical signs, staggering gait followed by ventral position or lateral position, and tachypnea were observed and mean body weight values in the treatment group were significantly lower than those in the control group. But clinical signs recovered within 2 hours after administration, thereafter no treatment-related abnormalities were seen until day 14 after treatment. In addition, no treatment-related abnormalities were found in both sexes at necropsy performed on day 14 after dosing (\"Toxicity Testing Reports of Environmental Chemicals\" (Chemicals Investigation Promoting Council) (Access on Aug. 2010)). Thus, these symptoms were not considered to be toxicologically significant. Therefore, for oral route, the classification corresponded to \"Not classified\" category.

Groups of 50 male and 50 female Wistar rats were fed diets containing 0, 12.5, 25, or 50 ppm fenarimol (purity,96.7%), equal to 0, 0.6, 1.2, or 2.5 mg/kg bw for males and 0, 0.7,1.5, or 3.0 mg/kg bw per day for females, for 24 months. Haematology and clinical chemistry were evaluated only at termination, and the liver was the only organ examined at necropsy. The survival rate was low due to an outbreak of chronic respiratory disease during the 16th and 17th months: only 10-32% per sex per group survived for two years There were no treatment-related effects on clinical signs of toxicity,haematology, or liver weight. Reductions in body-weight gain, food consumption, and food efficiency were observed in males at the high dose during the first year of the study. The glucose content of blood was increased in animals of each sex at 50 ppm. The incidence of fatty liver was increased at the high dose, especially in males (60%; 26% in controls). There was no evidence of an increase in tumour incidence,but the survival rate was not sufficient to meet the criteria for a valid negative result in a study of carcinogenicity. The NOAEL was 25 ppm, equal to 1.2 and 1.5 mg/kg bw per day for males and females,respectively (Hoffman et al., 1982a).[INCHEM]<br><br><br>"

The maximal plateau concentrations were 5.1 mg/kg fenarimol in muscle after one day, 14.1 mg/kg in carcass after four days, and 9.1 mg/kg in whole fish after two days, equivalent to bioconcentration factors of 60,175, and 113 for muscle, carcass, and whole fish, respectively. Depuration after transfer to uncontaminated water was biphasic, with DT50 values of 0.6 day for the first three days of depuration and 5.5-6.1 days for the last four days. Overall, &gt; 95% of radioactivity was eliminated within four days. [INCHEM]<br><br><br>Rapidly Degradable: No<br><br>Persistence in surface water<br><br><br>Fenarimol may reach surface waters by spray drift, direct overspray, or erosive run-off of water or particulate matter. Rapid photolysis is a possible mechanism of degradation, but this may not occur in turbid waters. In natural water-sediment systems in the dark, fenarimol partitioned rapidly into the sediment (75-80% within seven days), with a partition DT50 of &lt; 7 days, a DT90 of &lt; 14 days (re-calculated from raw data), and no appreciable degradation over 80 days (Jackson &amp; Lewis, 1994a). In a study conducted outdoors in the USA, a slower rate of partitioning from water to sediment was seen (DT50, 18 days; re-calculated from raw data) (Althaus &amp; Goebel,1981). This value does not agree with the probable photolysis rate or the results of the previous study; since the study was conducted in 1981, the result is considered to be less reliable. In general, irrespective of the route of entry of fenarimol into surface water, it will be adsorbed onto sediment and persist, as its degradation is slow.[INCHEM]<br><br><br>"

Based on this report, the substance was classified into Category 2 (kidney). Additionally, in 3-month mixed diet administration tests, hepatic centrilobular hypertrophy and necrosis were detected at >= 1000 ppm (132 mg/kg/day for male and 232 mg/kg/day for female) in mice and at >= 3000 ppm (158 mg/kg/day for male and 195 mg/kg/day for female) in rats; in both studies, doses administered were above Category 2 guidance values (JMPR (1992)).

Interim sacrifices were performed after 3 and 6 months (10 rats/sex/group), 12 months (20/sex/group) and 17 months of study (18 males and 10 females/group). The survivors (52 male, 60 female/group, maximum) were sacrificed after 24 months of treatment. Treatment with myclobutanil indicated a NOAEL for in-life parameters of 50 ppm, equal to 2.5 mg/kg bw/day. Effects of treatment at 200 ppm were observed as decreased testes weights in association with slight testicular atrophy at 24 months. At the highest dietary level of 800 ppm, testes weights were decreased at 12 and 24 months with slight to moderate increases in the incidence of testicular atrophy. (The seminiferous tubules were reported frequently found to be devoid of spermatid formation and germinal epithelial cells; the tubules appeared smaller than normal. In severe cases only Sertoli cells remained). Increased ovary weights in females treated at 800 ppm and sacrificed at 12 months were not correlated with any histomorphological changes. Other treatment-related effects noted at 800 ppm were decreased body-weights (both sexes) and food consumption (males), and increased liver weights (females). Increased MFO activity was recorded at 200 ppm in females (3 months) and at 800 ppm in both sexes (3 months) and in males (6 months). There were no treatment-related effects on survival, clinical signs, ophthalmoscopy, haematology, blood chemistry or urinalysis. Treatment with myclobutanil at dietary levels up to 800 ppm failed to uncover any evidence of carcinogenic potential (Shellenberger et al., 1986). <br><br><br>847.

A single oral dose of 500 or 1000 mg/kg bw was lethal. Single oral doses &gt; 10 mg/kg bw (lowest dose tested) induced marked, dose-dependent reductions in cholinesterase activity in plasma, erythrocytes, whole blood and brain, which returned to pretreatment values within 4, 24 and 48 h after doses of 10, 30 and 90 mg/kg bw, respectively. A NOAEL could not be identified in these studies with single doses. The LOAEL was 10 mg/kg bw. In the 13-week study of neurotoxicity, cholinesterase activity was significantly decreased by more than 20% in erythrocytes, whole blood, plasma, whole brain and individual brain structures at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg bw at weeks 4, 8 and 13 in a dose-related fashion.

In a study examining soils from agrochemical dealerships or railroad rights-or-way in central Iowa, rhizosphere soil samples, representing four plant fanilies, were not able to mineralize large quantities (greater than 8.5%) of 14C-metolachlor after 50 days(6). Samples were incubated in the dark at 20 deg C with a metolachlor concn of 50 ug/g(6). However, in a 14-day environmental chamber study with a 14 hr photoperiod, degradation of 10 ppm metolachlor, present as a mixture with trifluralin and atrazine, was shown to occur in non-vegetated soil (27% degradation) but not to the extent of the Kochia scoparia rhizosphere soil (48% degradation), suggesting that the rhizosphere of certain plant species may facilitate microbial degradation(7). <br><br><br>[(1) USEPA; Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) Database for Metolachlor.

In a study examining soils from agrochemical dealerships or railroad rights-or-way in central Iowa, rhizosphere soil samples, representing four plant fanilies, were not able to mineralize large quantities (greater than 8.5%) of 14C-metolachlor after 50 days(6). Samples were incubated in the dark at 20 deg C with a metolachlor concn of 50 ug/g(6). However, in a 14-day environmental chamber study with a 14 hr photoperiod, degradation of 10 ppm metolachlor, present as a mixture with trifluralin and atrazine, was shown to occur in non-vegetated soil (27% degradation) but not to the extent of the Kochia scoparia rhizosphere soil (48% degradation), suggesting that the rhizosphere of certain plant species may facilitate microbial degradation(7). <br><br><br>[(1) USEPA; Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) Database for Metolachlor.

The time required to attain equilibrium in catfish was found to be 3-4 days; and the depuration half-life in catfish was found to be 1.2 days(1). In another study, a whole body metolachlor BCF of 69 was reported for fish, with a whole body elimination of 93% after 14 days depuration(2). According to a classification scheme(3), these BCF values suggest the potential for bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is low-to-moderate(SRC). Limited data show that fish are unlikely to accumulate metolachlor because of rapid elimination(4).

In the USA on the other hand, the EPA has used data from animal studies to establish their chronic reference dose (or RfD, which is analogous to an ADI). This means that the US EPA have used an additional 10-fold factor in their RfD calculations, due to the extra uncertainty inherent in extrapolating data from animal species to humans. The TGA and the US EPA have regulated chlorpyrifos on the basis of its inhibition of plasma cholinesterase activity, which is the most sensitive measure of toxicity for chlorpyrifos and for a number of related organophosphorus compounds. The JMPR derived their ADI based on effects of chlorpyrifos on brain cholinesterase activity in animal studies, and erythrocyte cholinesterase inhibition in human subjects. Both of these measures of toxicity are less sensitive than the inhibition of plasma cholinesterase activity, and hence the JMPR ADI is higher than that recommended by Australian authorities. No Observed Effect Level / Acceptable Daily Intake - In Australia, the current Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for chlorpyrifos is 0.003 mg/kg/day, based on the NOEL for plasma cholinesterase inhibition of 0.03 mg/kg/day in a 28-day human volunteer study (Coulston et al, 1972), and using a 10-fold safety factor for individual variability. Following the considerations of the Advisory Committee on Pesticides and Health (ACPH) and the Scientific Director of the Chemicals and Non-Prescription Medicines Branch (CNPMB) of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), the current ADI for chlorpyrifos was affirmed. Acute Reference Dose - The recommended acute RfD for chlorpyrifos is 0.01 mg/kg, derived from an NOEL of 0.1 mg/kg/d in a human volunteer 28-day study (in which plasma and erythrocyte ChE activities were not inhibited at one or three days at any dose in the study), and using a 10-fold safety factor for individual variability.

Nine doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day caused plasma cholinesterase depression, but no other effect. These results were confirmed in a subsequent study of human volunteers who ingested chlorpyrifos daily for four weeks at levels of 0.014, 0.03, and 0.1 mg/kg; significant inhibition of plasma cholinesterase occurred only at the 0.1 mg/kg level.

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henrys Law constant of 2.9X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henrys Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 16 and 179 days, respectively(SRC), but adsorption may attenuate this process. In a laboratory study, 50 ppb of chlorpyrifos added to 10 liters of water was volatilized 85% in 24 hours(2). The hydrolysis half-life of chlorpyrifos in distilled water at 25 deg C was reported as 62 days (pH 4.7), 35 days (pH 6.9) and 22 days pH 8.1(5). According to a classification scheme(6), BCF values of 100-4,667 measured in fish(2) suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. In a shake-flask screening test similar to a river die-away test, chlorpyrifos degraded about 40% faster in active (natural) water as compared to the same water which had been sterilized with formalin(7). The reported half-life in active water was 24.5 days and with sterilzed water was 35 days(7).

Volatilization from water surfaces is expected(3) based upon a Henrys Law constant of 2.9X10-6 atm-cu m/mole(4). Using this Henrys Law constant and an estimation method(3), volatilization half-lives for a model river and model lake are 16 and 179 days, respectively(SRC), but adsorption may attenuate this process. In a laboratory study, 50 ppb of chlorpyrifos added to 10 liters of water was volatilized 85% in 24 hours(2). The hydrolysis half-life of chlorpyrifos in distilled water at 25 deg C was reported as 62 days (pH 4.7), 35 days (pH 6.9) and 22 days pH 8.1(5). According to a classification scheme(6), BCF values of 100-4,667 measured in fish(2) suggests that bioconcentration in aquatic organisms is high. In a shake-flask screening test similar to a river die-away test, chlorpyrifos degraded about 40% faster in active (natural) water as compared to the same water which had been sterilized with formalin(7). The reported half-life in active water was 24.5 days and with sterilzed water was 35 days(7).

In a biodegradability screening test using an activated sludge inoculum based on carbon dioxide evolution, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate reached 4 to 5% ThCO2 (theoretical amount of CO2 of this compound) after 28 days at an initial carbon content of 34.1 to 38.7 mg/l(14). 76 and 71% removal of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate was observed in a trickling filter system and an activated sludge system, respectively(15). Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate was biodegraded with a half-life of 60 to 70 hours in groundwater impacted by this compound, ethylbenzene, and xylenes(16). 81.5% (mean) biodegradation of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate was observed after 24 hours in semicontinuous activated sludge tests; 4 days were required to reach &gt;90% biodegradation in the activated sludge die-away portion of this test(17). <br><br><br>[(1) Price KS et al; J Water Pollut Contr Fed 46: 63-77 (1974) (2) Tabak HH et al; J Water Pollut Contr Fed 53: 1503-18 (1981) (3) Wolfe NL et al; Environ Sci Technol 14: 1143-4 (1980) (4) Hattori Y et al; Pollut Control Cent Osaka Prefect Mizu Shori Gijutsu 16: 951-4 (1975) (5) Saeger VW, Tucker ES; Appl Envion Microbiol 31: 29-34 (1976) (6) Johnson BT, Lulves W; J Fish Res Board Can 32: 333-9 (1975) (7) Sugatt RH et al; Appl Environ Microbiol 47: 601-6 (1984) (8) Subba-Rao RV et al; Appl Environ Microbiol 43: 1139-50 (1982) (9) Hutchins SR et al; Environ Toxicol Chem 2: 195-216 (1983) (10) Mathur SP et al; J Environ Qual 3: 207-9 (1974) (11) Bennett SR et al; Environmental Hazards of Chemical Agent Simulants CRDC-TR-84055, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD (1984) (12) Clapp LW et al; Water Environ Res 66: 153-60 (1994) (13) Wams TJ; Sci Total Environ 66: 1-16 (1987) (14) Struijs J, Stoltenkamp J; Ecotoxicol Environ SAF 19: 204-11 (1989) (15) Hannah SA et al; J Water Pollut Control Fed 60: 1281-3 (1988) (16) Graves DA et al; Appl Biotechnol Site Remed, Hinchee RE et al eds Ann Arbor,MI: Lewis Publ (1994) (17) OGrady et al; Appl Environ Microbio 49: 443-5 (1985)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br><br><br>[HSDB]"

                        "note": "A continuous breeding protocol was utilized to examine the reproductive toxicity of three phthalate esters. CD-1 mice were given diets with either di-n-propyl phthalate (DPrP: 0.0, 1.25, 2.5, or 5.0%), di-n-pentyl phthalate (DPP: 0.0, 0.5, 1.25, or 2.5%), or di-n-octyl phthalate (DOP: 0.0 1.25, 2.5, or 5.0%). Both male and female mice (20 pairs per treatment group, 40 pairs of control animals) were dosed for 7 days prior to and during a 98-day cohabitation period. Reproductive function was evaluated during the cohabitation period by measuring number of litters per pair, live pups per litter, and pup weight. There was no apparent effect on reproductive function in the animals exposed to di-n-octyl phthalate at dose levels sufficient to cause a significant increase in liver weight. Both di-n-propyl phthalate and di-n-pentyl phthalate were toxic to the reproductive system as evidenced by a complete inhibition of fertility at 1.25 and 2.5% di-n-pentyl phthalate or 5.0% di-n-propyl phthalate, and reduced fertility (litters/pair and live pups/litter, 0.5% di-n-pentyl phthalate; live pups/liter, 2.5% di-n-propyl phthalate). Toxicity of di-n-pentyl phthalate had a strong male component and female component, whereas di-n-propyl phthalate was more toxic to the female than the male reproductive system. Di-n-pentyl phthalate and di-n-propyl phthalate treatment was associated with decreased body weight, increased liver weight, decreased testis and epididymis weights, decreased epididymal sperm concentration, and elevated seminiferous tubule atrophy. A comparison of seven phthalate esters tested using this continuous breeding protocol indicates the relative order of reproductive toxicity as diethylhexyl, dihexyl, dipentyl, dibutyl, dipropyl; diethyl and dioctyl are nontoxic. <br><br><br>[Heindel FJ et al; Fundam Appl Toxicol 12 (3): 508-18 (1989)]**PEER REVIEWED** [HSDB]<br><br><br>"

However, since the test was conducted only at one dose level, therefore, the evaluation was impossible. As for the in vivo mutagenicity test in somatic cells, in the micronucleus test using bone marrow cell from mice orally administered, positive results in females and negative in males, showing a contradictory result, were noted (ATSDR (2003)). However, there was no description about the sex difference, and only one animal was used in the negative control group, therefore, the evaluation was impossible. In the chromosome aberration test using bone marrow cell obtained from mice orally administered via drinking water for 90 days at the dose level of 20 ppm, negative results were reported (ATSDR (2003)). However, it was difficult to evaluate the validity of the dose level of 20 ppm and the effects by the short-term high concentration exposure. Although another multiple in vivo test data, such as negative result in the micronucleus test using bone marrow from mice intraperitoneally administered, and negative results in the stomach, liver and kidney, but positive in the lung in the DNA damage test (in vivo genotoxicity test in somatic cells) using rats orally administered (ATSDR (2003)), were obtained, both of them were unable to be evaluated for classification. Therefore, the substance was classified as \"Classification not possible\". As relevant information, as for in vitro studies, negative results were reported in the Ames test (NTP DB (Access on Jun. 2009)) and chromosome aberration test using human lymphocytes and CHO cells (IARC 73 (1999)).",

For mice, hypoactivity, ptosis, ataxia, tremor etc. were reported within the dose range of 444 - 1332 mg/kg, and sedation, dyspnea etc. were reported in another study within the dose range of 1670 - 6000 mg/kg (IUCLID (2000)). While, in the study about neurological effects after single oral administration of 100 mg/kg to rats, the effects on the cerebellum containing reduction in cerebellar activity and abolish of the evoked spiked activity of Purkinje cells following stimulation of the radial nerves etc. were reported (ATSDR (2000)). As described above, the effects on the nervous system were suggested at the dose range equivalent to Category 2 of the guidance values or higher, judging from the signs observed in the acute oral toxicity studies. In consideration with the study report indicating the effects on the cerebellum as well, the substance was classified as Category 2 (nervous system). Otherwise, no serious toxic effects were found either at the concentration of 5.1 mg/L (as dusts) in inhalation route or at 2000 mg/kg in dermal route (IUCLID (2000)).",

Since the test dose levels ranged within Category 2 of the guidance values, the substance was classified as Category 2 (liver, kidney). While in the one-year feeding study in dogs, the most significant effect was the cardiopathy which was characterized by discrete myocardial degeneration, which was the most prominently found in animals receiving 1000 ppm (ca. 34 mg/kg/day). In the study, cardiac toxicity such as ascites, cachexia, labored/shallow breathing, and abnormal changes on the electrocardiograph (ECG) were reported, and dilatation of the right atrium as gross pathological examination, microscopically atrophy and myelosis were reported (IRIS (2004)).

Source: Biol Reprod 1998;58(Suppl 1):89 Abstract: Metabolites of the fungicide vinclozolin are structurally similar to hydroxyflutamide, a potent androgen receptor antagonist used in the treatment of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia. These vinclozolin metabolites act like hydroxyflutamide to competitively inhibit endogenous androgens from binding to and activating the androgen receptor and appear to mediate alterations in male sex differentiation and development by inhibiting androgen-dependent developmental processes. Here we report that procymidone, a dicarboximide fungicide similar in structure to vinclozolin, alters male sex differentiation and development consistent with the actions of an antiandrogen. Timed pregnant Long Evans rats were dosed orally from gestational day 14 through postnatal day 3 with 0, 25, 50, 100, or 200 mg procymidone/kg-bw/day and reproductive development of male offspring was evaluated from birth through adulthood. Similar to the effects of vinclozolin, procymidone exposure reduced anogenital distance in two-day old males and lead to permanent nipples. Procymidone also inhibited development of secondary sex organs and the external genitalia, producing significant weight reductions in the ventral and dorsolateral prostate, levator ani and bulbocavernosus muscles, cowpers gland, seminal vesicles and glans penis. Malformations of the external genitalia included hypospadias, cleft phallus, exposed os penis, vaginal pouch, and the highest dose produced kidney hydronephrosis, occasional hydroureter, epididymal granulomas and ectopic or undescended testes. This constellation of antiandrogenic effects precisely mirror those observed following developmental exposure to similar doses of vinclozolin. The antiandrogenic mechanism of procymidone was confirmed in vitro using cell-free androgen receptor binding and whole cell receptor binding assays together with transcriptional activation assays to show that a procymidone metabolite(s), but likely not procymidone itself, acts as an antiandrogen(s) by binding the androgen receptor and inhibiting androgen induced transactivation. The structure of the active metabolite of procymidone is currently under investigation. We suggest that procymidone is activated in vivo to an antiandrogenic metabolite(s) which has the potential to alter male sex differentiation and development. <br><br><br> <br><br><br>"

In the first generation the reduction in pup weight in the mid-dose group, in the absence of any adverse effect on maternal weight, could be regarded as a developmental toxicity effect. There was also a significant reduction of live litter numbers at all three dose levels. The effects in the second generation were more severe, with reduced pup weight in all groups including the low-dose group, structural defects (such as prepucial/ penile malformations, seminiferous tubule degeneration, and absence or underdevelopment of the epididymides) in the mid- and high-dose groups, and severe effects on spermatogenesis in the high-dose group that were not seen in the parent animals. These results suggest that the adverse effects of DBP are more marked in animals exposed during development and maturation than in animals exposed as adults only. No clear NOEL was established in this study. The lowest-observed- adverse-effect-level (LOAEL) was considered to be 66 mg/kg body weight per day. (WHO EHC 189 (1997))<br><br><br>[INCHEM]<br><br><br>"

F0 rats and F1 rats, derived from F1a litters, were exposed for 10-11 weeks before their single mating trials and were exposed for a total of 16-21 weeks before they were sacrificed. F0 parental effects were limited to<br><br><br>the high-dose group and included: tremors during the postmating phase in 3 dams and lower gestational BW gains and lactational BWs. F1 high-dose males and dams weighed respectively 26% and 16% less than did the controls after weaning; males still weighed 15% less at mating and 14% less at termination; females weighed 6% less at mating but had BWs equal to those of the controls at termination. F1 mid-dose males weighed less and had gained less weight than the controls at mating. F1 dams weighed less than the controls at the start of their gestations and gained less weight during their gestational and lactational periods. Tremors also were seen in 4 F1 highdose dams during their postmating phase. Fertility was not affected in an unequivocal manner in this study, but both F0 and F1 high-dose groups exhibited increased incidences of prolonged gestations (&gt; 24 d). Progeny effects included: decreased live litter size for the high-dose F2a litters and decreased pup survival and pup BWs during lactation for the F1a mid- and high-dose groups and for the F2a high-dose group. Progeny NOEL = 10 ppm (decreased pup survival and post partum BWs). <br><br><br>When first reviewed (Rinkus, 2/1/90), this study was considered unacceptable but upgradable upon submission of: 1) greater explanation of procedure and results for pup necropsies; and 2) justification for designating the mammary glands as the target organ. The Registrant responded by submitting records 092536, 095071 and 112990. Record 092536 is discussed in worksheet W092536.834 and the other two records are discussed in worksheet W073162.S01. This study now is considered ACCEPTABLE but the following new findings have been made: 1) the tremors appear to be the result of birthing problems, as opposed to organophosphate neurotoxicity; 2) the incidence of total litter resorptions was increased in each of the Diazinon-treated groups in the F2a trial; and 3) upon recalculation, the fertility index for the F2a trial was not de-creased; rather, the corresponding gestation index was decreased for each of the Diazinon-treat-ed groups (reproductive NOEL &lt; 10 ppm).

In the highest-dose group, four males treated at 100 mg/kg died during the first week of treatment. Consequently, the dose was reduced to 50 mg/kg. Clinical signs were observed in the highest-dose group and included anorexia, ataxia, fasciculations, tremors, diarrhoea, hypoactivity, hypotonia and salivation. Most of the signs disappeared after the dose was reduced. Mild dermal reactions were noted at site of test substance administration. Body weight gain and food consumption was similar in all groups, and most laboratory parameters remained unaffected by the treatment. Reduced cholinesterase activities were found in serum, red blood cells and the brain in animals treated at &gt;5 mg/kg.

Two males received 34 consecutive treatments (Group B), while the two other volunteers were treated for 4 days, were left untreated for the next 5 days in order to investigate reversibility of the effects &amp; then received the capsules again for 32 more days (Group A). The daily dose was split into three admin taken after meals around 9, 13 &amp; 19 hr. Parameters of hematology, urine analysis &amp; blood biochemistry (plasma &amp; erythrocyte cholinesterase, serum alkaline &amp; acidic phosphatase activities) were determined at regular intervals. A reversible decr of plasma cholinesterase activity was observed in group A during the first 4 days of treatment while the erythrocyte cholinesterase activity remained unaffected. During the second treatment period of group A &amp; during the entire treatment of group B, the cholinesterase activities were similar to those observed at pretest. No clinical signs or changes in other parameters were noted. It was concluded that the admin daily dose of 0.025 mg/kg marginally inhibited the plasma cholinesterase only, &amp; can therefore be considered as a NOAEL in humans. <br><br><br>[WHO; Environ Health Criteria 198: Diazinon p.74-75 (1998)]**PEER REVIEWED**[HSDB]<br><br><br>ADI (JMPR) 0.002 mg/kg b.w.

In a literature study, the degradation of diazinon was studied using both nonsterile and sterile soil/water systems.

At 6 deg C in the dark, the half-lives (days) for ultrapure water, river water, filtered river water, and seawater were 144, 181, 132, and 125, respectively(1). At 22 deg C in the dark, the half-lives (days) of diazinon in ultrapure water, river water, filtered river water, and seawater were 69, 80, 52, and 50, respectively(1). The lower half-lives in filtered river water compared to unfiltered results from slight adsorption of diazinon to particulate matter(1). At 22 deg C and illuminated under sunlight, the half-lives(days) of diazinon in river water and seawater were 43 and 47, respectively(1). A larger decrease in half-life for river water results from a greater concn of humic acid photosensitizers in river water which may be responsible for the degradation of diazinon(1). <br><br><br>[(1) Lartiges SB, Garrigues PP; Environ Sci Technol 29: 1246-54 (1995)]**PEER REVIEWED**<br><br><br>[HSDB]<br><br><br><br><br><br>"

Estimated half-lives for a model river and model lake are 21 and 160 days, respectively(3,SRC). Limited data, mainly derived by analogy to 4-s-butylphenol, indicate that 2-(1-methylpropyl)phenol may be resistant to biodegradation by non-adapted microbial populations(SRC). A 4-hydroxybenzoate adapted Pseudomonas strain was able to biodegrade 2-(1-methylpropyl)phenol (oxygen uptake rate of 42 nmol O2/min/mg protein)(5). A structurally similar compound, 4-s-butylphenol (at 100 mg/L) was not biodegraded over a 2 week period using an activated sludge inoculum(6); however, a phenol-adapted yeast strain, isolated from soil, readily oxidized 4-s-butylphenol (present at 1 mmole) without a lag period(7). An estimated BCF value of 180(3,SRC), determined from an experimental log Kow(2), suggests that 2-(1-methylpropyl)phenol may bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms(SRC) according to a recommended classification scheme(8). <br><br><br>[(1) Swann RL et al; Res Rev 85: 23 (1983) (2) Hansch C et al; Exploring QSAR: Hydrophobic, Electronic, and Steric Constants.

A linear, low dose approach (Q1*) is used for human risk characterization and the tumor incidence data used in this calculation is derived from the 1982 mouse carcinogenicity study (MRID 00114114, 00151822). The most potent unit risk Q1*, based on male mouse liver adenoma and/or carcinoma combined tumor rates, is 2.59 x 10-2 (mg/kg/day)-1 in human equivalents [converted from animal to humans by use of the (mg/kg body weight)3/4 interspecies scaling factor] (Memorandum: L.

AFter the lag phase removal was rapid with 50% removal in 1-2 days and 100% removal in 2-17 days. These data would appear to indicate that in natural waters bisphenol A may be classes as readily biodegradable meeting the 10-day test window.<br><br><br><br><br><br>[draft risk assessment of bisphenol A on ECB website]"

The end-points were chosen to evaluate both short-term and reproductive toxicity and several mechanistic and biochemical parameters. Administration of doses &gt; 0.17 produced dose-dependent increases in body weight, food consumption, and feed efficiency. At 0.69 and 4.1 mg/kg bw per day, minimal to mild non-regenerative anaemia, Lymphopenia, decreased serum cholesterol (at the high dose only), and altered splenic lymphocyte subtypes were observed. Changes in the weights of several organs were noted. Evidence of ovarian malfunction (reduced corpora lutea and large antral folicles) was found at doses &gt; 0.17 mg/kg bw per day. Pathological changes in males and females fed 0.69 or 4.1 mg/kg bw per day included centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy, diffuse hyperplasia of the pituitary gland, feminization of the male mammary gland, mammary gland hyperplasia in females, cystic ovarian follicles, hypertrophy of the endometrium and endometrial glands in the uterus, degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium, and atrophy of the testes and acessory sex glands (Biegel et al., 1998b)."

From animal tests, male progeny developed granulomas in the epididymis and testis and female progeny developed neoplasms on the cervix and vagina in a hamster test where the substance was administered by intragastric tube during gestation (IARC vol. 21 (1979)). Oral administration to pregnant monkeys resulted in vaginal ridging and/or cervical hooding in offspring (IARC vol. 21 (1979)). In mouse oral tests, increased pituitary weight and unclear estrus cycle in female offspring and atrophy of the epididymides and prostate in male offspring were observed (NTP DB Report#RACB830`46 (access on Oct. 2009)).

From animal tests, male progeny developed granulomas in the epididymis and testis and female progeny developed neoplasms on the cervix and vagina in a hamster test where the substance was administered by intragastric tube during gestation (IARC vol. 21 (1979)). Oral administration to pregnant monkeys resulted in vaginal ridging and/or cervical hooding in offspring (IARC vol. 21 (1979)). In mouse oral tests, increased pituitary weight and unclear estrus cycle in female offspring and atrophy of the epididymides and prostate in male offspring were observed (NTP DB Report#RACB830`46 (access on Oct. 2009)). It was also reported that a decreased fertility index was attributed to the reproductive toxicity to males (NTP DB Report #RACB83094 (access on Oct. 2009)).",

In the 2-generation study, the NOEL for body weight loss was set at 10 ppm [between 0.65 (male) and 0.74 (female) mg/kg bw/day] because of significant losses at the next higher dose of 120 ppm. The NOEL for reproductive toxicity was 30 ppm (3.0 mg/kg bw/day for females) based on poor pup survival and an inability of pups to gain weight during lactation at higher doses in the 3-generation study. In the 2-generation study, a NOEL for reproductive effects was set at 40 ppm (equal to 3.07 mg/kg bw/day for females) given the reduced pup weight, viability and lactation indices at the next higher dose of 120 ppm.
